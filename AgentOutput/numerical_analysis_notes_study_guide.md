# Study Guide: Numerical Analysis Notes

## 1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Definition**: SVD is a method of decomposing a matrix into three other matrices, revealing many of its useful properties.
- **Applications**: 
  - **Matrix Compression**: SVD is crucial for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving essential features.
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Widely used in data science for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

## 2. Taylor’s Theorem
- **Overview**: Taylor's Theorem provides an approximation of a function as a sum of its derivatives at a single point.
- **Importance**: It is a fundamental tool in numerical analysis, allowing for the estimation of function values and error analysis in numerical methods.

## 3. Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
- **Concept**: This theorem addresses the conditions under which a polynomial interpolation exists and is unique.
- **Key Points**: 
  - Ensures that given a set of points, there is a unique polynomial that passes through all of them, provided certain conditions are met (e.g., the points must not be repeated).

## 4. Image Representation
- **Challenges**: Processing and compressing images involves various complexities, particularly with different types of images.
  - **Grayscale Images**: Simpler representation but still requires efficient algorithms for compression and processing.
  - **Color Images**: More complex due to the additional data channels (RGB), necessitating advanced techniques for effective handling.

## 5. Linear Equations
- **Rounding Errors**: In numerical solutions, rounding errors can significantly affect the accuracy of results.
- **Ill-Conditioned Systems**: These systems are sensitive to small changes in input, leading to large variations in output, making them challenging to solve accurately.
