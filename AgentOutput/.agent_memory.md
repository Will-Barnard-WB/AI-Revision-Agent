- [2026-02-22] test: v2 upgrade implementation verified
- [2026-02-22] created: Minimum_Polynomial_CayleyHamilton_Study_Guide.md — comprehensive study guide covering min poly definition/uniqueness/existence, divisibility property, eigenvalue-root correspondence, Cayley-Hamilton theorem with adjugate proof, and applications (inverse, high powers, diagonalisability)
- [2025-07-14] research: Compiled comprehensive university-level study guide on the Geometric Distribution covering both conventions, PMF, mean/variance/MGF proofs, memoryless property, CDF, relationships to Negative Binomial and Exponential distributions, worked examples, and common mistakes.
- [2026-02-22] created: Poisson_Geometric_Distributions_Study_Guide.md — comprehensive study guide covering Poisson (PMF, mean/variance proofs, MGF/PGF, Poisson limit theorem, additive property, Poisson process) and Geometric (two conventions, mean/variance proofs, MGF, memoryless property + uniqueness proof, CDF, NB/Exponential relationships), plus side-by-side comparison. No lecture notes available; sourced from web research.
