### Answer Key

#### A. Definitions
1. **Answer:** The algebraic multiplicity of λ, am(λ), is the multiplicity of λ as a root of the characteristic polynomial ∆ φ.
2. **Answer:** The geometric multiplicity of λ, gm(λ), is the dimension of the eigenspace Eφ(λ).

#### B. Short Answer
3. **Answer:** The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ensures that the characteristic polynomial has at least one root, which implies that φ has an eigenvalue.
4. **Answer:** Theorem 3.9 states that a linear operator φ on a finite-dimensional vector space V over C has at least one eigenvalue, which is crucial for the proof of the Spectral Theorem.

#### C. Problem-Solving
5. **Answer:** The algebraic multiplicity of λ = 2 is 3, and for λ = 3 it is 2. The geometric multiplicities must be determined based on the eigenspaces, which may vary.
6. **Answer:** p(φ)(v) = p(λ)v = (λ^2 - 4)v. This shows that v is also an eigenvector of p(φ) with eigenvalue p(λ).
